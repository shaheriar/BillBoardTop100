# Findings
In conclusion, we can say that the Pop Songs from 2000-2018 featured very energetic, danceable, fast music that was often recorded in-studio. Pop Songs favor lyrics over instrumentals and the vast majority utilize the infamous 4 on the floor.

Something that surpised the both of us was the use of Minor scale. We thought it would be Major dominated, but it turned out to be a 70/30 split. In addition, most Keys were used uniformly, except for the key of C and C#.

We also found a trend between the Tempo and the Energy and Danceability. In general, the higher the tempo, the more energetic and danceable the music is.

If you want to make the next Pop hit, use a 4/4, 120 BPM, C Major Scale song, that utilizes its tempo to make a song that is both energetic and danceable.
